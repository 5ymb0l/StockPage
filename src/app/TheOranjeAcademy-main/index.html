          Our aim is to provide India, with football players of the highest
          calibre who can represent us, all across the world and promote
          football as a career choice while increasing the popularity of the

        <p>
          The Oranje as the name suggests seeks inspiration from Dutch football
          team and more specifically the Dutch philosophy of Total football. The
          way football has evolved over the years, clearly shows the importance
          of skill and technique over physical play and endurance. Football has
          various styles and tactics involved and each way as its merits and is
          the right way.

        <h3 class="h3">THE TOTAL FOOTBALL COACH</h3>
        <p>
          We at 'The Oranje' feel it is very important to add to the child's
          natural ability by coaching and guiding them in a free environment
          rather than teaching then wherein they are forced to follow our lead
          and copy us. Every child has a talent and we approach each of them
          differently and the intention is to improve each and every child and
          not just focus on making the already good players better. We stress on
          punctuality, team work, hard work, discipline and respect for the
          opponent.

        <h3 class="h3">ETHOS</h3>
        <p>
          We at 'The Oranje' believe we can help kids play football in a more
          enjoyable, productive and efficient way that will change their outlook
          towards football coaching and help them realize their dream through
          proper coaching and guidance. There are basically three stages in
          football as a child develops. A technical stage, a tactical stage, and
          an information stage. The physical development takes place on its own
          as the child enjoys playing and thus running with the ball. But
          warm-up, conditioning, cool-down and a proper diet are very important
          if a talented kid wants to realize his full potential and hence is a
          crucial part of our setup.

        We strive to change perception of football in our country, so that they
        can look towards football as a genuine career path for their children
        and thus we can help the country by providing football players of the
        highest caliber.

        Here at 'The Oranje football Academy', we have a panel of professionals
        which includes more than 30 licensed coaches including also a
        psychologist, a medical consultant and a nutritionist. The assistant

        Satyajeet personally, and everyone is are well aware of the philosophy
        that we propagate. The level of coaching throughout the academy is
        consistent. We don't believe in hiring coaches or asking fellow

        philosophy differs. We try to give our best on the pitch, we have and
        utilise, the best equipment possible and provide a very good playing
        surface.

              Total football basically means a player can play anywhere across
              the pitch with ease. But it needs a high level of skill,
              concentration and team work. A player needs to work on 5 basic
              footballing attributes such as passing, movement, organization,
              communication and positioning, couple with personal attributes
              such as concentration, calmness, composure and awareness. And all
              of it can be achieved through proper coaching & personal effort.
