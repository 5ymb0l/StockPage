          <h2>2018 MAIDEN YEAR</h2>
          <p>
            The Oranje as the name suggests seeks inspiration from the Dutch
            football team and more specifically the Dutch philosophy of Total
            football. The way football has evolved over the years, clearly shows
            the importance of skill and technique over physical play and
            endurance. Football has various styles and tactics involved and each
            way has its merits and is the right way.

          <h2>2020 PANDEMIC STRIKES</h2>
          <p>
            We at 'The Oranje' believe we can help kids play football in a more
            enjoyable, productive and efficient way that will change their
            outlook towards football coaching and help them realize their dream
            through proper coaching and guidance. There are basically three
            stages in football as a child develops. A technical stage, a
            tactical stage, and an information stage.
