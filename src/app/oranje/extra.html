      <p>
        Here at 'The Oranje football Academy', we have a panel of professionals
        which includes more than 30 licensed coaches including also a
        psychologist, a medical consultant and a nutritionist. The assistant
        coaches are also some of the best players that have been trained by
        Satyajeet personally, and everyone is are well aware of the philosophy
        that we propagate. The level of coaching throughout the academy is
        consistent. We don't believe in hiring coaches or asking fellow
        footballers or friends to coach for us, as the level of coaching and the
        philosophy differs. We try to give our best on the pitch, we have and
        utilise, the best equipment possible and provide a very good playing
        surface.
